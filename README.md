Reasy seamlessly integrates with databases and web services and even facilitates communication with third-party systems through supporting connectors and API integrations. The best part is that you don't need to install or download anything. Simply sign up and start creating apps; Reasy takes care of hosting them on its cloud infrastructure, accessible from anywhere.

With Reasy, you can rapidly develop enterprise applications that meet your business requirements and easily modify them as your business scenarios evolve.

## Key Features

**Version Control:** The REASY Platform allows you to maintain multiple versions of a solution, allowing rolling back and forth of versions as per the business requirements. With version control, all solutions can be tested concurrently in a sandbox, allowing change requests to be managed without impacting the live application.

**Multi-tenancy**: Reasy supports multi-tenant architecture, each with a separate domain. Users invited by the domain admin will be a part of that tenant and can share apps among them.

By sharing, you provide them with access to your apps. In addition, it helps you break down the complexity and simplify the app development process when working collaboratively.

**Image/PDF to Screen:** Reasy's AI generator converts your images and PDFs to standard HTML pages. Its cutting-edge model analyzes the imported image or PDF, including wireframes, sketches, and mockups, and predicts the best tools for each component. The "Tagger" tool further allows you to validate and align as you need.

**Prompt-Driven Screen Generation**: This is an innovative and efficient approach that leverages the capabilities of Chat GPT to generate HTML screens based on prompts provided by users. Create dynamic and interactive web pages by simply describing your requirements in natural language.

**Reasy App as PWA:** Leverage the speed of low code in building PWAs (Progressive Web Apps) that give you a native mobile app experience. With PWAs, eliminate the dependency on app store licenses and approval processes to get your mobile-optimized application. Reasy has made PWA development easier, faster, and more affordable. The platform turns your application into a PWA when you enable it in your app settings with a simple toggle. We offer offline support, push notifications, and a few configurable messages. You can notify your users to install it through a pop-up, and users can immediately install and use it!

**Reasy App to Mobile App**: This feature empowers you to easily transform your Reasy apps into native mobile applications for both Android and iOS devices. It allows you to extend your web app's existing capabilities to reach a wider mobile audience without the requirement for extensive mobile development expertise.
