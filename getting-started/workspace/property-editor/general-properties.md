# General Properties

Though each component possesses different properties, a few of them are common. This section helps you get a brief overview of each of them.

**Data Model**: This property helps you bind your UI elements to target attributes in your data model, so you can store and expose data dynamically.

**My ID**: This is a unique ID that Reasy generates for every single screen component. You can use this ID to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet and manipulate a particular element in JavaScript. Click ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (34).png>)to copy it for use.
