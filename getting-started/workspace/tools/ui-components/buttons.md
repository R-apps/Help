# Buttons

Buttons serve as interactive elements that trigger specific actions upon being clicked. They can perform a range of functions, from navigating to different screens to submitting forms or executing other tasks.

By understanding user behaviors in various contexts, Reasy offers a diverse selection of buttons designed to cater to diverse needs, making the development process smoother and more user-friendly. Reasy's button options are extensive and user-centric, ensuring that developers can easily incorporate them into their applications. Just drag and drop them to use in your app. Furthermore, these buttons come with a unique property that enables you to display them with plain text, an icon, or both, all with a simple click. This flexibility allows you to create buttons that align perfectly with your app's design and functionality.

Reasy provides individual buttons for quick access, but it also allows you to change button types seamlessly through the Property Editor. This empowers you to customize the appearance and buttons' behavior, ensuring a consistent and intuitive user experience.
