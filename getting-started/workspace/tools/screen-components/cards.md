# Cards

A card component, resembling a physical card, is a versatile and stylish way to display information within a contained and visually appealing container. You can put in a wide range of content types, including text, images, and interactive elements such as links and buttons within a card. With a little creativity, you can use it in a variety of ways to enhance your website's design and functionality.

Include card components in your app design to:

* Provide a clear visual hierarchy, making it easy for users to distinguish different sections or pieces of information.
* Organize content, allowing developers to present information in a digestible format.
* Focus on key information.
* Serve as clickable elements, allowing users to navigate to different sections or perform actions directly from the cards.
* Make the app interface more engaging and interactive, and many more.

It's a great alternative to plain text blocks because it allows for easy organization and adds a touch of style to your application. But how do you use it? It's simple. Drag the appropriate card type and customize it to your liking; you can choose the size, shape, and background color.

Reasy includes a library of ready-to-use cards that can be dragged onto the canvas, eliminating the need to create any card type from scratch. Each one serves specific purposes, catering to various types of content or functionalities.&#x20;

Let's go over each card type:
