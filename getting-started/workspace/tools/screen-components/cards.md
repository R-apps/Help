# Cards

A card component, resembling a physical card, is a versatile and stylish way to display information within a contained and visually appealing container. You can put in a wide range of content types, including text, images, and interactive elements such as links and buttons within a card. With a little creativity, you can use it in a variety of ways to enhance your website's design and functionality.

Include card components in your app design to:

* Provide a clear visual hierarchy, making it easy for users to distinguish different sections or pieces of information.
* Organize content, allowing developers to present information in a digestible format.
* Focus on key information.
* Serve as clickable elements, allowing users to navigate to different sections or perform actions directly from the cards.
* Make the app interface more engaging and interactive, and many more.

It's a great alternative to plain text blocks because it allows for easy organization and adds a touch of style to your application. But how do you use it? It's simple. Drag the appropriate card type and customize it to your liking; you can choose the size, shape, and background color.
