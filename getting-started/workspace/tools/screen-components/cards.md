# Cards

A Card component resembles a physical card and effectively displays information compactly and visually appealing. Cards can contain a variety of content like text, images, and interactive elements like links and buttons. They are typically used to display content such as product listings, as a dashboard component, and others.

Incorporating card components in your app design to:

* Provide a clear visual hierarchy, making it easy for users to distinguish different sections or pieces of information,
* Organize content, allowing developers to present information in a digestible format,
* Focus on key information,
* Serve as clickable elements, allowing users to navigate to different sections or perform actions directly from the cards,
* Make the app interface more engaging and interactive, and many more.

Use cards in your design to enhance the user experience.&#x20;
