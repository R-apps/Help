# Custom Components

Considering a variety of business scenarios, Reasy offers a range of draggable tools like the barcode, webcam, chatbot, and others under the "Custom" category. You can drag them and customize their behavior and appearance as needed.

Let's go over each of these components.

### Webcam

The Webcam component lets users capture photos or enable live interactions using their device's camera within the app. It is a handy tool for seeing things in real-time.

#### Use cases

This component is best used for remote interviews, virtual workshops, or user identification processes.

### Doc Viewer

The Doc Viewer lets you easily view different document formats in the app. You do not need external tools to preview documents. You can do more than just viewing. You can search, highlight content, and switch to presentation mode for a better view. You can enable rotation and annotations to offer your users a more convenient way.
