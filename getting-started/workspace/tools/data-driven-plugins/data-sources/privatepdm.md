# PrivatePDM

The "PrivatePDM" plugin allows you to add a new attribute that is required in the API flow but is not necessarily present in the input or output attributes. This is a transient attribute that can be used within the API.

### How to Use?

Drag the PrivatePDM plugin into your API flow. Click **Add New Field** to create an attribute and define its attribute name and datatype in the Input and Output Configuration tabs.

### Use cases

Use private PDM to define an attribute that stores the job ID (a temporary value) of a job process.
