# Logout

The "Logout" plugin lets users end their session. You can use it to let your users log out manually or automatically when their session times out or when they're done using your application, like after submitting a form or updating information.

### How to Use?

Just drag and drop the plugin into your app's interface. Customize the settings to define when and how a specific user can log out. You can even define success and failure actions and make the result appear locally or globally. This allows you to offer a personalized experience based on your application's requirements.
