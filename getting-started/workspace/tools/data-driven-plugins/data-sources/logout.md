# Logout

The "Logout" plugin enables users to terminate their session. You can use it to let your users log out manually or automatically when their session ends. You can include a logout button in your app to allow users to log out.

### How to Use?

Drag and drop the plugin into your app's interface. Customize the settings to define when and how a specific user can log out. You can even define success and failure actions and make the result appear locally or globally. This allows you to offer a personalized experience based on your app requirements.

### Use cases

This is usually used in e-learning apps, banking and financial apps, e-commerce apps, travel apps, and more.
