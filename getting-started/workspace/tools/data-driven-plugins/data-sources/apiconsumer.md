# APIConsumer

The APIConsumer core plugin helps you connect to and use external services or data in your app. This plugin helps you easily integrate services such as travel apps, payment gateways, social media platforms, and data providers into your applications. It supports both REST and SOAP API formats.

### How to Use?

Simply drag and access the plugin interface, then enter the API URL you want to use. Provide the format, URL, methods, and content type. You can include service headers like fixed headers, dynamic headers, or response headers. Add request and response templates and save the API settings. Further, you can choose to display and use the response code locally or globally.
