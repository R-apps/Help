# PropertyReader

The "PropertyReader" plugin allows you to fetch specific properties stored within your application, such as configurations, user details, or any custom settings. It's like having a handy assistant that fetches the information you need on demand.

### How to Use?

Drag the plugin into your API flow. Configure the plugin to select the specific property you want to retrieve. Determine the data types for the property values and use them within your API.\
