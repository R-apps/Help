# JoinPlugin

The "Join" plugin helps you concatenate the data available in two different arrays. It returns an array as a string by concatenating all of the elements in the two arrays, separated by commas or a specified separator string, keeping the original array intact.

For instance, you can use this plugin to combine employee records with department details to create a comprehensive employee directory. This allows you to create custom datasets tailored to your unique needs.

### How to Use?

Drag and drop the Join plugin into your flow. Configure the plugin by selecting or specifying the key attributes of the arrays you want to join.&#x20;

1. Save and execute to see your data seamlessly joined for a richer and more insightful experience.
