# DateUtils

The "DateUtils" plugin is like a personal assistant for managing dates. The range of utilities available in this plugin takes the hassle out of dealing with dates, letting you focus on what matters mostâ€”whether it's planning events, meeting deadlines, or collaborating globally.

With these date utilities, you can quickly and easily format dates, figure out time differences, work with different time zones, and more.

### How to Use?

Add the plugin to your API flow. Choose the utility you need and tell it what format you need. You can choose your own input or output formats with this plugin, even though it comes with several formats. Make sure to validate the custom formats before you use them. Set the attributes in the Input Configuration to tell the plugin what to do and attributes in the Output Configuration to get the status. Then, use the results in that API.
