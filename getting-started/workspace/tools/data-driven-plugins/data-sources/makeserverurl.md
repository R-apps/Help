# MakeServerURL

The "MakeServerURL" plugin generates a dynamic URL for the specified file using the rules you specify. It works perfectly when you choose to use a URL to view or download a file. You can use this URL to allow users to change their profile pictures, download an identity proof or a document via a specific URL, and more. The source file can be an image, HTML, PDF, or any other.

### How to Use?

Just drag and drop the MakeServerURL plugin into your API flow. Choose the source file and configure the rules to generate a dynamic URL in the plugin settings. The plugin creates a server URL based on your settings, so your users can easily access the correct resource.

### Use cases

This is commonly used in analytical dashboards to download specific reports, the filled-out 15H form from the banking app, and others.
