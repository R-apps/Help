# EmailReaderPlugin

The "EmailReader" plugin lets you read emails and extract useful data in a specific format from the chosen source. You can use it to automate email tasks and make workflows more efficient. E.g., you can use it to extract leads from incoming emails and add them to your CRM or sales pipeline.

### How to Use?

Add the plugin to your API workflow. Select the data source, username, and password, and select to read emails from either the inbox or a specific folder. You have options to:

* Read emails batch-wise, or
* Read emails between dates, or&#x20;
* Read emails from a specific person, or&#x20;
* Read all emails

Based on the option you choose to read from, configure it in the Input Configuration tab.

You also have the option to read only new emails, mark emails as read, and move them to a folder. After you set it up, configure it to extract data from incoming emails. This includes information such as the sender, subject line, body text, date, attachments, and more.
