# Data-Driven Plugins

Data-driven plugins are tools that use data from various sources to add new features or automate tasks. These plugins make it easier to work with data by reducing the need for complex coding. You can connect them to databases, external services, or other data sources to perform advanced data tasks directly within apps. This way, even those without deep programming skills can handle data effectively.
