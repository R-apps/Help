# Tools

**Tools** are elements that you drag onto the canvas to build app interfaces, define APIs, and create workflows. When dragged onto the canvas, they are referred to as "components". You can manage the properties of these components using the Property Editor.

Reasy offers a comprehensive range of tools to simplify the app-building process for you. A **Toolbox,** located to the right, contains all the visual components and tools for business processing modeling.

* **UI Components**

UI (User Interface) components play a crucial role in building your app's interface and enabling interactivity. In addition to the input elements like text fields, buttons, drop-downs, and others, you also have access to analytical, informational, and custom components. Additionally, there are a few pre-built components available to expedite the design of your app's interface, eliminating the need to create them from scratch.

Building your appâ€™s interface in Reasy is a breeze; simply drag and drop the UI elements. For a deeper understanding of each component, [click here](ui-components/).

* **BPMN Components**

BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation) tools employ standard notations that help you create process maps to visualize your business processes. These tools enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of your workflows, making the entire process smoother.\
For further insight into these elements, [click here](bpmn-components/).

The tools are either integral to Reasy's core library or are added through plugins.
