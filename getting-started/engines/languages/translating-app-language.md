# Translating App Language

To change your app's language,

* First, choose a translator. Open the **Languages** engine, click![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/More actions (5).png>), and select **Settings**. Choose to set a translator.
* Next, add locale(s). Click![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Create (3).png>) and select the language(s) to which you wish to translate your app’s content. The selected locale(s) appear in the Navigation Explorer.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: “English” will be the default locale. You can translate your app content from English to other locales.
{% endhint %}

Open the locale to see the translated text.

Despite the auto-translation, you may need to tweak a few syntaxes and idioms. Also, you may need to translate currencies, measure units, format for dates, addresses, phone numbers, and a few others.&#x20;

To do so, double-click the locale; the platform displays all the labels in your app’s interface, as you see here.

Here,

* The platform displays the count if your app contains multiple labels with the exact text. Click the count to expand to view and edit the labels individually.
* To locate a label and its information, click![](https://reasyapps.com/forum/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Label-info.png).
* Next, select the label(s) and click ![](https://reasyapps.com/forum/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Translate-checked-labels.png)to translate. The platform then translates the content in those labels using your default translator.
* View the translated content. If you wish to make any changes, you may use the virtual keyboard by clicking ![](https://reasyapps.com/forum/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Virtual-Keyboard.png).
* Finally, save your translations.

Everyone cannot be an expert in languages. So, you may need the assistance of language experts from time to time. But how can you let them access your platform? In such cases, export your app’s display content for selected locale(s) and share it with the language experts. Let’s see how.

Click![](https://reasyapps.com/forum/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Export-model.png)to export and select the locale(s); the display content will be exported as an Excel file. Then, share it with the language experts. Post the translation, and import it to the platform by clicking![](https://reasyapps.com/forum/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Import-model.png). Here’s how the exported file will look.
