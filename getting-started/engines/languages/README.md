#### What is localization? <a href="#what-is-localization" id="what-is-localization"></a>

**Localization** is adapting your app to a specific region. It helps you to translate your app content to other languages. Making your app regionally relevant puts it in reach of a worldwide audience. Reasy supports almost all the languages across the globe.

#### When to use it? <a href="#when-to-use-it" id="when-to-use-it"></a>

Localize when you want to target the global audience with your app. Localizing your app content makes it more appealing to your audience, which as a result, makes them likely to give a try and buy it.

The **Localization** engine in Reasy lets you translate every character your users see on your app’s interface. To provide you with automatic language translations, Reasy has two inbuilt translators – “Yandtran” and “Google”.
