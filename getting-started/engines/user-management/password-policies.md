# Password Policies

Passwords are sensitive and confidential, which is why you should define rules for enforcing strong passwords using a **password policy**. Also, it enhances your security.

You’ll have a default policy with basic rules. You can use this default policy if you haven’t created one. Let’s see creating a custom password policy to define your own set of rules.

* Switch to **Password Policies** and click **Custom Password Policy**.
* Give it a name, set the rules you need, and then save it.

Here are all the password policies you’ve created. You can

* View the policy by clicking![](https://reasyapps.com/forum/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/View.png).
* Edit the policy by clicking![](https://reasyapps.com/forum/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Edit.png). Modify and update it.
* Delete a policy by clicking![](https://reasyapps.com/forum/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Delete-policy.png).
* Slice and dice the policies to view as per your preferences
