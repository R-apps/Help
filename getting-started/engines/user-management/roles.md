# Roles

The **Roles** assigned to your users determine their access level to your app. Roles help you define user access, such as what a user can do and view.

To create a role,

* Give a unique name to the role and provide a brief description of it.
* Then, assign permission templates (policies) to define access permissions for the users with this role.

### Manage Roles

* Delete a role by clicking![](https://reasyapps.com/forum/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Delete-policy.png).
