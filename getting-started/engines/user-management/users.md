# Users

Users are your stakeholders, involved in your business processes. They can be an Administrator, a Project Manager, a Solution Architect, a developer, or a tester, or they might be playing other roles that exist in your organization.

To create a user,

* Switch to the **Users** tab, and select **Create new user**.
* Enter the information necessary to create a user. Next, select a role for the user, assign a password policy, and select the status, as you see here.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**:\
1\. When you enter a Login ID, the platform shows its availability. If it is already in use, enter a different ID. UIDs (Login IDs) help you easily identify users.\
2\. Ensure you provide a valid Email Id and Mobile number when creating a user. If the user forgets their password, you can share it with them via their email ID and mobile number.
{% endhint %}
