# Policies

A policy is a way of securing access to your app. The **Policies** allow you to set permissions for the users to access your App and its essentials (Screens, Data, Microsites, etc.). These policies are bound to the roles, which means the users with those roles can have access according to the policies assigned to them.

A default policy called "Administrator" is available by default, with access to all modules and features, making it ideal for setting initial access permissions.

To create a policy.

* Click **Create new policy** under **Policies**.
* Give the policy a unique name and provide a brief description of it.
* Select the Resource type (engine), and the platform displays the resources available in it. Then, select the resources a user can access with a role that has this policy.

Here are all the policies youâ€™ve created. You can

* View the policy details by clicking![](https://reasyapps.com/forum/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/View.png).
* Edit a policy by clicking![](https://reasyapps.com/forum/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Edit.png). Modify and update it.
* Delete a policy by clicking![](https://reasyapps.com/forum/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Delete-policy.png).
* Slice and dice the policy list to view as per your preference.
