# Layout Setup

You can customize the starting layout when users open the app, defining the first thing they see. This customization is crucial for establishing the first impression and directing users to the main functionalities of the app.

When you open the Navigation engine, you'll see the Main Flow, which specifies your app's initial layout. While Reasy defaults to the Login Layout, you can select a different vibe if your app includes multiple layouts.

To change the initial layout, open the Main Flow, select the desired layout, and save your preference.
