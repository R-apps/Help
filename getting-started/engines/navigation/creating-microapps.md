# Creating Microapps

Microapps lets you add small, focused functions wherever you need them in your app. Creating a microapp is like building a mini app for a specific purpose.

Making a Microapp is simple.&#x20;

* Open the **Navigation** engine and create one by clicking '+', or right-click the Main Flow and select **Add Microapp**.&#x20;
* Once created, give it a unique name to have a clear differentiation between the microapps.
* Open it and visually create a flow to define how it should function. As microapps can do a lot â€“ from calling external services (APIs) to managing user authentication, you can just drag and connect tools to set up the flow.
* Configure the tools involved in the flow to define what action they have to perform and exactly where you want your users to move.

Finally, save the microapp.

Similarly, you can create more microapps as required, maintaining a hierarchy that mirrors your app's navigation menu. This replication simplifies the process of defining user pathways, enabling users to manage when and where users can navigate within the app more easily.
