# Navigation

The **Navigation** engine in Reasy facilitates you to define and control how users navigate within your app. The Navigation engine offers an interface where you can visually define the pathways your users take through your app, using microapps.&#x20;

Microapps are like mini-apps that let you add functionalities without cluttering the main app. They help you keep things organized and efficient.
