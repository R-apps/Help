# Data Modeler

### Whatâ€™s a Data Model?

A **Data Model** visually represents how the data is organized, connected, and structured. It comprises entities, representing tables, and attributes, representing table columns.&#x20;

Writing queries to create tables is considered traditional. Reasy offers a visual approach to crafting your data structure. Furthermore, it provides a unique set of commands for data creation, manipulation, and deletion.

### Why do you need it?

As most applications rely heavily on data, it is crucial to have the proper data model in place to efficiently manage your business processes. A data model is where you store and manage all the data that you enter manually or that is dynamically collected through the application. With a link to your UI elements, it all works behind the scenes. Your users will only see your app's interface without any clue about how their data is manipulated. In Reasy, entities come with their own set of services to create, read, update, and delete data.

Furthermore, you can even join entities using [Entity Relationships](entity-relationships.md), allowing for complex queries and analysis of the data.&#x20;
