# API Configuration

Here, in the API configuration, you can handle the events, set the SLA (Service Level Agreement) timer, and display messages.

To configure,

* Click ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/Configure.png)in the canvas toolbar; the platform displays its basic details in the **Information** tab.
* Switch to the **Event Manager** tab to handle events. When creating an event, choose whether the event is available only for the current process or for the current application.
* Configure SLA for your API. Set a time to start the service.
* Set a message to display it to the users when any process execution fails.
