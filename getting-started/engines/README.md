# Engines

**Engines** in Reasy are the app's essentials or building blocks. These app essentials collectively empower users, including citizen developers, to create a wide range of applications efficiently, from simple prototypes to complex business solutions, without the need for extensive coding expertise.

These app essentials include:

* **Interface Designer:** A drag-and-drop interface designer that allows you to create the application's user interface (UI) visually. This includes designing forms, screens, and layouts.
* **Data Modeling:** Define and manage your app's data. This may involve creating databases, defining tables, setting up relationships, and specifying data types.
* **Workflow Automation:** A visual interface for defining the application's business logic. You can configure rules, triggers, and actions to streamline and automate tasks within the app.
* **API Services:** Allows you to stretch the app's capability to connect to external systems, databases, or services through pre-built connectors or custom APIs. This enables data exchange and interaction with other software.
* **Resources:** Define all the resources such as email source, data source, and others to make them globally available throughout your app.
* **User Management:** Tools for defining user roles, permissions, and access control to ensure security within the application.
* **Multilingual Support:** Effortlessly convert your app to any other specific language with the built-in translators and virtual language keyboards.
