# Screens

Screens are the HTML pages (User Interfaces) you see and interact with while using an app.

The significance of screens cannot be emphasized enough, as each screen serves a specific purpose, whether it be capturing user input or displaying important information. Therefore, it is essential to carefully consider the layout and functionality of each page to ensure an optimal user experience. Reasy's simple drag-and-drop interface makes building screens a breeze.

The **Screens** engine helps you design and build responsive user interfaces for your app like a pro, all without writing a single line of code.&#x20;
