# Manage Screens

### Screen Versioning

Reasy's versioning mechanism offers you the ability to version control your screens. When you want to freeze a screen, right-click it and select **Create version**. Reasy creates a version of it while preserving the screen's integrity. You can view your screen versions by selecting **All versions** from the right-click menu. Moreover, you can make any of those versions active just by toggling the respective status button.

### Rename

With this option, you can change your screen name instantly. Select **Rename** from the right-click menu of a screen to change its name.

### Duplicate

With this option, you can rapidly replicate your screen. Instead of creating a screen that is identical to one that is already present in your app, you can simply duplicate it by selecting **Duplicate** from the right-click menu. The duplicate will have the same name appending with "copy". Therefore, it is advisable to rename the duplicate before you utilize it.

### Delete

You can easily delete a screen if you no longer need it by choosing **Delete** from the right-click menu. Make sure not to delete a live app's screen.
