As you create your app, you will be provided with a default 'Login' layout and a 'Main' layout to give you a head start. If your app includes a login page, you can simply customize and use it, saving you the trouble of designing it from scratch.

Before you start customizing or creating a layout, here are some tips to consider to make your app more appealing and user-friendly:

### Importing a layout

If you already have a layout created outside of Reasy that meets your requirements, you can import it here.&#x20;

To import, switch to the **Import** tab in the Layout selection wizard and select the zip file containing CSS, pictures, JS, and HTML files.&#x20;

Use it as is or you can make the necessary changes to fit your app and save your changes.&#x20;

### Element Tagging

Tags help Reasy understand the elements of your layout. You do not need to tag when using Reasy layout patterns and elements as they are self-tagged. In the case of imported layouts, it is necessary to tag their elements, for the platform to understand them. For instance, if the imported layout has a header, footer, menu, language picker, logout, and other elements, you must tag all of them.&#x20;

The **Tagging Elements** tab has access to every layout tag. To label the elements in your layout, simply drag them there. Once you're done, save it.

For the platform to understand the different elements in the imported layout, tag them using the **Tagging elements**.  header, footer, and any unique objects within it, such as Logout, Language, menu, and so on. To tag an element, switch to **Tagging Elements** tab in the Toolbox and drag the necessary tags to the elements in the layout.
