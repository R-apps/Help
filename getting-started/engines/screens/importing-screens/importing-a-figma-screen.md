# Importing a Figma Screen

You may use Figma to visualize user-facing features and interactive aspects and create rough mockups, wireframes, and prototypes. This feature helps you quickly turn those wireframes into interactive and responsive screens without having to deal with HTML code.

This article will guide you through the process of importing a Figma screen into your Reasy app and show you how easy it can be.

* Expand the layout in which you wish to import a Figma screen, then go to **Screens** and \
  right-click '![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (48).png>)' to select **Import Figma Screen**. \
  ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/Import Figma screen\_selection.png>)
*   Enter the URL of the Figma file and click **Submit**.

    <figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Import Figma screen_link.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
* Enter your Figma credentials and then click **Accept** in the displayed pop-up, to gain access to Figma, where it can import the screen from the link you provided.
* The screen is then imported and made available in Navigation Explorer.

The imported screen can now be accessed from the Navigation Explorer. Open it and make the necessary changes to it.
