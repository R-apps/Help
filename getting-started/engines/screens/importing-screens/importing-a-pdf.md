# Importing a PDF

This feature allows you to include PDF files in your app as web pages. If you have a PDF brochure and want to convert it to a web page to incorporate into your web app, this feature makes it simple.

To import a PDF,

* Expand the layout into which you want to import a PDF, go to **Screen**, right-click '![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (48).png>)', and select **Import PDF**.\
  ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/Import PDF\_Selection (1).png>)
* Choose or drop a PDF file from your local storage, and then click **Import**.

The imported PDF is now available as a screen in the Navigation Explorer. Open it and customize as required.
