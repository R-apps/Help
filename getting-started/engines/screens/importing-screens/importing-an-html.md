# Importing an HTML

Using this feature, you can effortlessly bring in the HTML pages built outside of Reasy.

To import an HTML,

* Expand the layout you wish to use for the HTML to be imported, then go to **Screens** and \
  right-click '![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (48).png>)' to select **Import Screen**. \
  ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png>)
* Choose the HTML file to be imported, and then click **Import**.

<div>

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/import screen wizard (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

 

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/import screen_with file (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

The imported HTML can now be accessed from the Navigation Explorer. Open it and customize it as you require for your app.

By default, the imported HTML uses the preferences of the layout to which it was imported. Add additional dependencies, such as images and custom CSS, to the Assets folder in that layout.
