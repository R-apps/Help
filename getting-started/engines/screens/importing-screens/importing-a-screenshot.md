# Importing a Screenshot

This option allows you to convert a static image or a design file in PNG, JPG, or JPEG format into a fully interactive and responsive web page, so you can add it to your app.

This even ensures that the web page appears exactly as designed, maintaining pixel-perfect precision. It also speeds up your development process as it eliminates the need to manually code and design every element from scratch.

To import a screenshot,

* Expand the layout into which you want to import a screenshot, go to **Screen**, right-click '![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (48).png>)', and select **Import Screenshot**.\
  ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/Import screenshot\_selection.png>)
* Choose or drag the screenshot in PNG/JPEG/JPG format from your local storage, and then click **Import**.\
  <img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Import screenshot_wizard (1).png" alt="" data-size="original"> ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/Import screenshot\_file (1).png>)
*   Reasy, using a few Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, intellectually identifies the image elements and tags them with the appropriate tools. If you find any element left unidentified, you can use '+' to highlight it and select the tool to tag to it.\

    <div align="left">

    <figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Annotating unidentified tools in the screenshot (1).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    </div>
* After clicking **Create Screen**, it gets imported and made available in Navigation Explorer. Open it and make the necessary changes to it.
