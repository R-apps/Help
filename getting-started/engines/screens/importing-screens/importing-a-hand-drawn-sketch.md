# Importing a Hand-drawn Sketch

This feature lets you convert your hand-drawn sketches into screens. Upload your hand-drawn sketch, and with just a click of a button, your screen will be ready.

To get started, take a picture of your hand-drawn sketch and save it as a PNG, JPG, or JPEG image. Import the image, and the platform will convert it into a fully interactive and responsive web page with pixel-perfect accuracy. This efficient process eliminates the need to manually code and design each element from scratch, speeding up your development process significantly.

Here's how to import a hand-drawn sketch:

* Expand the layout where you want to import the sketch, go to **Screen**, right-click '![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (48).png>)', and select **Import Hand-drawn Sketch**.\
  ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/Import Hand-drawn sketch\_selection.png>)
* Choose or drag the sketch in PNG/JPEG/JPG format from your local storage, and then click **Import**.\

* The platform uploads it and provides a sketching guide. Scroll down to go through the sketching guide. Make sure you follow the guide, as the platform can understand the elements only if they are drawn in a specific way, as demonstrated in the guide.\

* Then, using a few Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, Reasy intellectually identifies the elements in the sketch and tags them with the appropriate tools. \

{% hint style="info" %}
In case you find any element is tagged inappropriately or left untagged, you can manually tag it.
{% endhint %}

* Once you confirm that the elements are tagged correctly, proceed with creating the screen.

Then, open the screen, and make the necessary changes if needed.
