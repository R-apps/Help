# Workflow Templates

Workflows can be sequential, transactional, event-driven, and so on. Reasy has templates for all these workflow patterns. Each template has a brief that tells you what it does. Use these templates to visualize your business processes quickly and effortlessly.

To use a template,

* Create a workflow and open it on the canvas.
* Next, click![](https://reasyapps.com/forum/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Manage-entity-on-canvas.png)on the canvas toolbar and select **Sample Templates**.
* Then, choose a template that suits your needs and import it.

As a best practice, we recommend you click ![](https://reasyapps.com/forum/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Full-view.png) to view the template in maximized mode and read its brief before selecting it.

Now, tailor the imported template the way you want it, and configure the flow elements to define their actions.
