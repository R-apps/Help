# Creating Workflows

Letâ€™s create a workflow from scratch. To create,

* Open the **Workflow** engine and click![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Create (2).png>) in the Navigation Explorer; a new workflow item is added.
* Give it a unique name and open it on the canvas; you get a default flow as you see here.
* Now, tailor the flow by dragging the required BPMN elements as per your requirement.

You may also use the quick-access tools to ease your work. Click the activity on the canvas, hover your mouse over the arrow, and you will get the quick actions. Use these quick-access tools to add as many activities as you need to your flow. Later, change their type by clicking![](https://reasyapps.com/forum/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Change-plugin.png), and configure them. Make sure to include the **End** node and save the flow.

When creating a workflow, you may need to perform specific actions on your flow elements. All actions you can take on them are available in the canvas toolbar.

* To differentiate the steps for different tasks in a flow, group them. Select the elements on the canvas and click![](https://reasyapps.com/forum/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Group-1.png).
* To create a copy of an element or a group, select it on the canvas and click![](https://reasyapps.com/forum/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Duplicate.png).
* To save a customized element, select it on the canvas and click![](https://reasyapps.com/forum/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Save-for-later.png).
* Should you wish to rearrange your flow, click![](https://reasyapps.com/forum/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Beautify-1.png). Then, click **Rearrange** to start and keep clicking **Next** until the process reaches 100%.

1. [Optimize](https://reasyapps.com/forum/?ht\_kb=optimize-complex-workflows) your workflow if it contains a long sequence flow of lines.
2. To define and re-use complex sets of repeatable activities in your workflow, use Signal Events.
3. Be sure to rename each element before you configure it when adding one to the flow.
4. Be sure to configure all the plugins before validating the flow.
