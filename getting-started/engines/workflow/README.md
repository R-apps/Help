# Workflow

### What's a workflow?

A **workflow** outlines the steps involved in accomplishing a specific task. It is a roadmap that guides you through tasks in a logical and efficient manner.

### Why do you need it?

Workflows bring structure and clarity to even the most complex business processes. Workflows ensure that everyone involved knows what needs to be done, how to do it, and when to do it. Workflow lets you automate your business processes.&#x20;

Sometimes, changes in expectations, technology, or stakeholders may impact your business processes. In such cases, workflows help you identify redundancies and increase accountability. In addition, they allow you to gain insights into whatâ€™s happening within your business processes, the people involved, and how effectively your business is meeting its deadlines.

Using workflows, you can automate repetitive tasks and orchestrate your business processes seamlessly. Workflow orchestration helps you handle multiple automated tasks to execute a single significant process.
