# Invite & Manage Users

When users individually create their accounts, we allocate a dedicated space for each user within our highly secure cloud infrastructure. It's important to note that we treat all user information with the utmost confidentiality and prioritize their security.

Upon creating an account, you will be considered an Administrator. This Administrator role provides access to the **Admin** page, allowing you to manage your domain effectively.

Reasy welcomes you with a freemium plan, offering you the opportunity to explore the Reasy way of building apps. However, you have the flexibility to upgrade your plan anytime, considering your app needs.

The admin dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of your current plan.

### Invite Teammates

To invite users to your space, navigate to the **Manage Users** module, where you can view the total and active users, as well as the number of administrators.

As an administrator, when working collaboratively, you might want to control users' access to specific engines in Reasy. You can achieve this by assigning them appropriate roles when inviting them to your space. Here's how: click **Invite Users**, provide the invitee's email address, and select the role from the available options.

In this context, reasyapps is the domain name and is used to access your web apps after launching them.

The roles available here are fully supported by Reasy.

* Selecting a specific engine permits the invitee to access only that specific engine.
* "Solution Manager" grants access to all engines.
* "Account Admin" provides administrative access.

This action sends an email invite to the invitee, which remains valid for 24 hours from the time of sending. You can track all the invites sent in the **Invites** section and cancel any pending invites at any time before they are accepted and logged into Reasy.

#### Manage Users in Your Domain

Once the invitees join your domain, their accounts are listed in the Users section.

As an administrator,

* You can change a user's role anytime.
* In cases where teammates resign, change their email address, or for any other reason, you can suspend their access to the platform.

Additionally, you can quickly search for users by their name or email address.
